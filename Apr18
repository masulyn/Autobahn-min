Nofib runs (measure Autobahn runtime as well):
  Original
  Only Remy
  Pre + Remy
  Remy + Post
  Pre + Remy + Post
  
  - Pre + Remy vs. Remy: 
    - no significant change in Autobahn runtime: previous claim is wrong
      (runtime apparently not dependent on size of bit vector but on program runtime)
    - Significant decrease in bangs generated while maintaing similar improvement
    

- Aeson pattern matching
  - Definitely missing some patterns...

- Aeson's profile varies on size of input
