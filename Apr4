- Submitted abstract yay!
- Successfully generated new profiles for external modules in Aeson
- But Autobahn and Parsec have a bug (placing bangs in instance declarations)
- Will need to replace Autobahn's boilerplate code to manually traverse and fix bug
- Currently trying to figure out how to traverse AST of huge Parsec parse results
