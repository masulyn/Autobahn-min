Benchmark Categories:

Good = Consistently successful benchmarks (as determined by at least 3 runs)
Too Fast = Original run time too fast, phase 1 refuses optimize (discard after 1 run)
Not Optimized = phase 1 optimized too little, minimizer refuses to minimize (discard after 1 run)
Inconsistent = Occasionally failed, occasionally successful benchmarks (run 10 times, find average)
Bad = Consistently failed benchmarks (as determined by list from Dio and at least 3 runs. find out why and discard)
Broken = Original benchmark failed to build (discard after 1 run)

*Success = whether there was at least 1 non error-code runtime result (even if optimized runtime equals unoptimized runtime)
*Too Fast = < 0.05 runtime
*f = failed
*s = succeeded
*parse error: builds on its own but can't be parsed
*nobits = no bits generated?
