Graphs:
  - normalize runtime (original runtime 1)
  - change bangs y axis scale to < 20
  - darken color of min instead of original
  - gaps between programs
  - label very long columns

Problem Programs:
  - Talk to Dio, figure out exactly how they handled them
  - Report problem programs by marking and explaining with asterisk
    - Report average and minimum of 10 runs
    - Negative run time returns original unopt program for both optimizing and minimizing phases
