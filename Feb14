Update on problem programs:
  - not caused by minimizer (non termination/timeout -> negative runtime in nofib -> autobahn 2.0 error code)
  - timeout in Autobahn (non termination or bad run)
  - coincide with problem programs in Remy's paper
  - solution: fix Autobahn or ignore for now (increasing timeout)
  - can occassionally be fixed using minimzer (fluid, expert, power, simple, treejoin)
  
 Tweaked graphs, need to label very long columns
