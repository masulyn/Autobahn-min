- Generate a graph including: 
  - data for 3 versions programs (original files, phase 1 optimized, minimized)
  - 6 columns for each program (runtime and # of bangs)
  - colorcoded columns
  - might spread to two rows of graphs
- Implement check if phase 1 optimized runtime = original runtime, then don't minimize
- Eliminate GHC proven safe bangs from minimized results
- Investigate and fix problem programs and programs with negative runtime
