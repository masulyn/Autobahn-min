1. Tweaked graphs - messy labels
2. Ran gcSimulator
  - gcSimulator requires >=4.8.0 < 4.9 base, but minimizer requires 4.9 base (upgraded gcSimulator for now)
  - parsing errors (manually fixed for now)
  - Could not minimize because improvement was minimal
3. Ran demand analysis 
  - haven't finished running it on all nofib benchmarks yet
  - usually around 1 or 2 safebangs marked so far
4. Talked to Dio - confirmed unreported nonworking programs in paper, still in process of getting average runs
