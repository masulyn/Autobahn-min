1. Rerun experiments on server
  - identify interesting experiments by category, run them multiple times and find average
  - Sort graph by decreasing runtime
2. Move gcSimulator experiments onto server
  - Run on larger trace files
  - Ask Dio about upper constraint of base for gcSimulator
3. Finish demand analysis, mark in graph as part of minimized bangs column
