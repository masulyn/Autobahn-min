- Ran into many many major issues with running experiments on server (very frustrating)
  - GHC was being upgraded once more and got permission denied for two days
  - Disk quota exceeded (twice in two days)
  - aeson exception (stack upgrade)
  - gcSimulator still not reproducing results (manually fixed errors and forced rebuilding)
- Created experiments master log
  - aim: categorize and record every single run on all benchmarks for ~ 8 runs
  - reality: couldn't complete more than two runs because of server issues
- Randomized generator to guarantee randomness
- Deadline: I am worried I might not get results in time but I am very determined to make this work.
