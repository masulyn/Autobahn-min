- Created graphs (but looks a bit messy)
- Implemented insignificant improvement check (error or 0 bangs?)
- "Problem" programs fixed
  longer than expected:
    - fannkuch-redux, fasta, n-body 
  not enough input:
    - anna, atom 
  illegal method definition:
    - fulsom, symalg 
    - fixed, pattern bindings (except simple variables) not allowed in instance declarations
  autobahn cannot optomize, basetime negligible:
    - banner, ansi, awards, pretty, scc, gen_regexps 
    - Remy's paper included them? maybe basetime check was implemented later?
  -1 runtime fixed after rerunning phase 1:
  fluid
  expert
  multiplier
  power
  simple - 
  sorting - didn't work... not included in Remy's graph either
  treejoin
  anna
  atom
  fulsom
  symalg
  fannkuch-redux  
  fasta
  n-body

- GHC demand analysis: parsed file...hear back from Remy

To do:
  - Finish GHC Demand Analysis part
  - Combine Autobahn and min?
  - Fix graph (messy)
