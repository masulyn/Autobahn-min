Nofib:
- find fluctuations between original programs
- find programs with no cost centres for original programs
- find average of good benchmarks and best/worse (improvement per bang)
- send abstract to kathleen (look at remyâ€™s paper) by friday
- 3 thresholds (6% improvement, bang impact, cost center size), roughly run experiments to catch surprises, 
  explain in paper what they do
  
Aeson and gcSim:
- Find way to generate profiles
- Run
