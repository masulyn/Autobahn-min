1. Heap profiling testing
  - Generally, hit or miss
  - Some trends when compared to time profiling (look at chart below):
    - Mostly worsened performance (not eliminating fewer bangs but eliminating all aka giving up, or not terminating)
    - Sometimes comparable
    - Occasionally very good! (Eliminated fewer bangs but improved time performance or eliminated more bangs)
  closer look at calendar
2. Quick check 
  - Confirmed that random test input generator works on finding non terminating input in small programs (fibonacci)
  - most nofib programs already check for bad input
  - lcss: bad input (negative third number in input array) could result in non termination (irregardless of if there's a bang)
  - Still valuable if it can find bad input, but not sure how valuable until run large scale experiments on more programs
  - To run large scale experiments: need to a way to automatically generate test generators based on input type
  - Potentially: apply quick check at the very end, although my guess is that it won't be very helpful
3. Winter break plans
  - Talked to Sam
