1. Heap profiling testing
  - Generally, hit or miss
  - Pre-phase:
  - Aut:
  - Post-phase:
  - huh? anna, atom, queens prolog, cichelli
  - worsened performance: sorting, wheel-sieve2, tak, fish, bernouilli
  - comparable: lcss
  - better: calendar, boyer2
  
  closer look at calendar
2. Quick check 
  - works on fibonacci
  - most nofib programs already check for bad input
  - lcss: bad input could result in non termination (irregardless of if there's a bang)
3. Winter break plans
