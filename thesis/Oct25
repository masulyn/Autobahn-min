    - Need a second committee member
    - Format? (30-40 pages) when to start worrying about this
    - Deadlines: timeline suggests substantial amounts of writing thorughout the year
    - Length, time (6, 7 weeks left) determines scope of work

Next steps:
    - Run experiments on heap allocations profile report (time consuming but can run in the backgroun) goal: run on nofib x 10, garbage collector, complete by November 8 (2 weeks). What to do after? Seems inefficient to run on both heap and time optimization...could we combine them? how to know when to use heap and when to use time
    - StrictCheck (quantifying specification in terms of performance)
    - GHC plugins (only available on 8.6)
